# Python-Flask-Hospital-Management
This is my first Python Flask project wherein a Hospital Management System has been designed allowing admin to register new patients, update/delete their details. Also, there is a Pharmacy section displaying details of medicines issued to various patients. It also keeps record of the available medicines and updates regularly on new issue.
